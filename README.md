# DedicatedDatabaseServer

## About This Project
This is a personal curiosity experiment.  I've never done a project where the database server and web server were
kept separate.  My projects have always assumed the database backend being localhost with respect to the web server.

## Plans
The web app will probably just be a dumb notes program.  Nothing fancy there.
  
By the way.... Stricly optional but a load balancer in the picture could be interesting.

We'll see where this all goes.  The only sure thing is that this project should have a lifespan of roughly a week to
two weeks max.
